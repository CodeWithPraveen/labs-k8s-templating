# Repository for the Kubernetes + Helm templating tool lab

## Create and Use a Package using the Helm Templating Tool

## Overview
The team had been struggling to manage various manifest files involved in running a Kubernetes cluster. The app exposes the weather services of a city using RESTful APIs. The manager wants to explore the solution of packaging them and deploying them as a single package. You are a Kubernetes Administrator tasked with defining multiple Kubernetes objects as a Helm chart. You will create a Helm chart that includes the deployment and service definitions for the app. Next, you will install the Helm chart to create the Kubernetes resources for the app. Finally, you will verify the installation by checking the API to fetch the sample weather details.

## Learning Objectives
- Awareness of manifest management and common templating tools.
- Configure Helm in the Kubernetes cluster.
- Create a Helm chart file containing deployment and service definitions.
- Install the Helm chart to create Kubernetes resources. 
- Test the installation to validate the Helm package. 

## What will you learn?
- Helm Chart
- Kubernetes
- Creating reusable charts with Helm.
- Packaging the Kubernetes manifests as a Helm Chart.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Helm and Helm Chart. 
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes.
- Familiar with Kubernetes internals, core concepts, and kubectl tool.
- Familiarity with YAML syntax and RESTful APIs.
